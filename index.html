                How we work: We approach every project with a rigorous interrogation of site, context, and client demands. At each stage of our design process, communication is essential, as we work collaboratively with the client and stakeholders to refine our conceptual and formal trajectories before proceeding. Ultimately, our design process concludes with a clearly defined conceptual problem that is answered through an architectural form. Form is not the goal, but the result of our design process.
                <br/>
                <br/> With this trajectory in mind, our studio has developed prototypes— like the Courtyard House— for new ways of living, working, and learning that are dedicated to the radical exploration of nature, ecology, and urbanism through innovative architecture.
                <br/>
                <br/> The office’s expertise is in connecting the individual to the collective: from framing how people live at the scale of a room, to new ways of living convivially and resiliently at the scale of a city. The office focuses on understanding how the world was organized in the past as well as the present, in order to understand how the world can be organized in the future, liberating the actual space for the physical and direct communication between people.
                <br/>
                <br/> NO ARCHITECTURE is an internationally award-winning practice based in New York City. The office is involved in a diverse range of projects that include the Flower House, a residential structure in the Berkshire Mountains published in Cultured Magazine; the Courtyard House recently nominated for the Mies Crown Hall Americas Prize and featured in Cultured Magazine, Architecture Now! 2015, Taschen, AD Germany, Architectural Record, Dwell, and Wallpaper*; Hester Hotel, a 18,000 sf boutique hotel located on the Lower East Side, NY, BY; 865 UN Plaza, a residential commission published on the cover of Casa da Abitare; and This Is Not A Park, a proposal for a new public park in Berlin, which the Union Internationale des Architectes awarded the Japan Institute of Architects Prize. The office focuses on understanding how the world was organized in the past and present, in order to understand how the world can be organized in the future, liberating the actual space for the physical and direct communication between people. In 2011, PIN-UP Architecture Magazine featured Andrew as one of the ten up-and-coming architects in New York City.
                <br/>
                <br/> Andrew Heid is the founding principal of NO ARCHITECTURE. Currently, Andrew is a contributing editor at Cultured Magazine, and has taught as an adjunct assistant professor at the GSAPP at Columbia University, and as a lecturer at the New York Institute of Technology’s School of Architecture. He has also been an invited juror at Harvard, The Cooper Union, The Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies, NJIT, Pratt, Parsons, Temple, UCLA, and Yale. His graduate architecture design studio is focused on cooling neighborhoods in hot cities: designing climate resilient urban eco-districts. Recently, he has lectured on “Housing and Habitat in the 4th Industrial Revolution” at the Positive Economy Forum, and at the Beijing International Design Week. In 2015, he exhibited “From Collective Form to Ecological Urbanism: Towards Climate Resilient Housing” at Re-Living the City, 2015 BI-CITY BIENNALE OF URBANISM ARCHITECTURE, Shenzhen. In addition, Andrew exhibited work in the Shenzhen Design Forum 2011, MoMA’s Tall Buildings, and his thesis in the Beijing Architecture Biennale.
                <br/>
                <br/> From 2005-2008 he practiced at REX and O.M.A. in New York and Rotterdam. At O.M.A., Andrew was the lead architect working directly with Rem Koolhaas for a 671,893 m² mixed-use, vertical “medina” in Tunisia. Also at O.M.A., he worked on the design for the Dee and Charles Wyly Theatre in Dallas, Texas. In 2005 and 2006, he designed and edited a book with the prominent architect and educator Peter Eisenman, titled, Ten Canonical Buildings: 1950-2000, Rizzoli 2008. Andrew studied architecture at Yale, the Architectural Association, and received his M.Arch from Princeton, where his design thesis earned the Suzanne Kolarik Underwood Prize, the graduate school’s highest honor.
